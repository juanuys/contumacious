# Represents a damage-dealing hit to be applied to a target Battler.
# Encapsulates calculations for how hits are applied based on some properties.

# There are two main reasons to bother using a class like Hit:
# - It allows and forces you to pass a single value to the battler when it should take damage.
# - It encapsulates only the information the battler needs to know about the attackâ€™s effect.
