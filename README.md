# Intro

Contumacious Commuter is a commuter-themed real-time card game inspired by Slay The Spire, and my daily commute.

Built on [godot-card-game-framework](https://github.com/db0/godot-card-game-framework).

# Art

I'm planning to uses cel/outline-shaded low-poly Blender models to speed up animation a bit, as hand-drawing everything will take way too long (even thought I might do that anyway one day!).
